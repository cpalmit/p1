	<h2>A little about me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I work at Wellesley College as the social media manager. I also enjoy folding origami, hence the image. The lady bug just happened to mosey into the shot when I was taking it.</li>
          	<li>I'm taking this course as part of my ALM in IT with a concentration in digital media arts and instructional design.</li>
          	<li>I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, D3, C, and Java, but haven't had much time for coding unless it's for class, so I tend to get a little rusty.</li>
          	<li>I'm on a Mac.</li>
          	<li>That's it.</li>
		</ul>
